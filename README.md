# AugmentedRealityApp

This is a beta version of my augmented reality app intended to scan products by just tapping on it with the camera in the app, and then estimating the price by using Ebay APIs.
Currently working on integrating Ebay APIs, but everything else is functional. I utilized Apple's ARKit and Apple's Core ML software to create an augmented reality app
in Swift that allows users to tap on the product. Once it is tapped, the ML algorithm will predict what it is and display a 3D text over it.
